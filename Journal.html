	<h3>October 10th, 2024</h3>
	<h4>Yesterday I made my name card and put my website on the internet. Today I finally decided the theme of my website - Diary of Wimpy Kid. The home page will have three characters, each linking to a certain part of my website. Right now I am trying to figure out all the features and commands of HTML.  </h4>
	<h3>October 28th, 2024</h3>
	<h4>Today I worked on the jumpscare project. We started learning JavaScript and some of its functions, such Event Listeners. This jumpscare project has given me some extra practice with making divs and giving them attributes in CSS. I also learned how to make divs links and put divs within divs.</h4>
	<h3>November 7th, 2024</h3>
	<h4>Today I made my website more coherent. I did this by making the links to my projects on my projects page as Diary of A Wimpy Kid Characters, similar to my home page. I am planning to have many characters for the many projects that I make this year. </h4>
	<h3>November 18th, 2024</h3>
	<h4>Today I finished making my clock. To complete the project, I had to learn how to write functions in JavaScript so that the image consistantly duplicates in a set interval. To make it count time, I assigned an increasing variable labelling the number of images. 
	<h3>December 16th, 2024</h3>
	<h4>Today we worked on if-then and else statements. Coding them is similar to coding functions. You enter an input in the if statement, and if the input is true, it runs what you tell it to run. Similarly, the code will run something else under the if else code if something else is true (or it's false).</h4>

	<h3>December 18th, 2024</h3>
	<h4>Today I am working on uploading three more projects to the projects page on my website, including the audio, colors, and clock projects. To do that, I need to make divs with images of new Diary of a Wimpy characters with each being links to a project.</h4>
	<h3>January 13th, 2025</h3>
	<h4>Today we worked on the "slotmachine" project. I coded four divs, three of which were the same. The other div acted as the "handle" of the machine. I had to make an event listener of click for the handle. When clicked, a random color appeared in each of the three divs. I did this using math.random and using the result to correlate to a color of a list. This project also inolve "if-then" statements because of the way scoring worked. </h4>
	<h3>February 6th, 2025</h3>
	<h4>Today I finished the confetti code for my valentines day project. Making the confetti required things like for-loops, functions, and event listeners. I made the confetti so it goes diagonally across the screen. There is a heart in the center of the screen that is a link to another page, which has a photo of my mom and I surrounding by a heart. I also added the confetti/valentines project to the projects page of my project.</h4>
	<h3>February 27th, 2025</h3>
	<h4>Today Molly gave a lecture addressing students' questions. We went deeper into for loops and learned a method of creating divs instantaneously but being easily able to assign values to individual divs. Now we understand how Molly made the team page of the website.</h4>
	<h3>March 6th, 2025</h3>
	<h4>Today we dedicated the class towards revamping our websites. I have been thinking how to make my home page more intersting since right now I just have an image. I am also considering if I should put captions benath the pictures in the home and projects page to indicate where the link goes to, but I want to have it so the user doesnt know, making them explore the website. </h4>
	<h3>April 3rd</h3>
	<h4>Today we began brainstorming ideas for our final project. Here are some of my ideas:
	1. Geography minigames
		a)There is a mystery country and it tells you how many miles away your guess is from the country.
		b) Geography trivia and fun facts integretated into a videogame. 
		c) There is a country whose letters are unscrambled. Get as many as you can in a certain amount of time. 
		d) You can create your own country by taking certain aspects of other countries. For example, a random country will be chosen and you have to say which trait (GDP, population, land, etc) you want for your country.
  2. Biology minigames
  	a) There is a skeleton and it asks you to click on a certain muscle or bone.
  	b) Biology fun facts integregrated into a videogame.
  3. Immune system simulation
  4. Choose your own adventure.</h4>
  <h3>May 12th, 2025</h3>
  <h4>I decided on the Geography game for my final project. Today I finished the draft for my second mini game, the trivia game. I made an array with trivia questions and had a function where the user could enter their answer and would receive feedback. It was a similar process to code the first game where the user has the unscramble the country. The next step is to code the game where the user has to input the name of a flag.</h4>
